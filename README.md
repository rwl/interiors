# interiors

The `interiors` crate solves non-linear programming problems (NLPs) using a
primal-dual interior point method. It is based on the [MATPOWER Interior Point Solver (MIPS)][1].
MIPS is based on [code written in C language][2] by Hongye Wang as a graduate
student at Cornell University for optimal power flow applications. It was
later ported to the MATLAB/Octave language by Ray D. Zimmerman for use in [MATPOWER][3].
